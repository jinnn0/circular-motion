# Circular Motion

Circular Motion is one of my lastes experiments and techniques 
I have been exploring.

It uses the Math.sin() and Math.cos() trigonometrical functions
to triger the dynamic x, y values and to create the circular motion in 3 dimentional space 

The full list of projects will be uploaded in the near future.

Meanwhile have a look at the animation [Circular Motion](https://jinnn0.github.io/circular-motion/) and let me know how you can leverage this effect
